Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about software development, Linux, open-source contributions, and building scalable applications.  
Currently, I’m developing **KShare** — Private, Cross-Platform File & Folder Sharing Hub

## 🚀 Latest Project: [KShare](https://github.com/rahulkuzur3/kshare)

## 🚀 Features


*   🖥 *Truly Cross-Platform:* A single, unified experience. Share files between a Windows PC, a MacBook, a Linux machine, and an Android phone without any compatibility issues.

*   🌐 *100% Offline & Local:* Operates entirely on your local Wi-Fi or a personal hotspot. Your data never leaves your network, guaranteeing privacy and maximum transfer speed.

*   🔮 *Zero-Configuration Discovery:* No more fumbling with IP addresses. KShare uses the *Zeroconf (Bonjour/Avahi)* protocol to automatically discover other devices on the network. They just appear in your list.

*   🔒 *Peace of Mind with AES-256 Encryption:* Every file and folder is protected with industry-standard *AES-256 (CBC mode)* end-to-end encryption. A unique password set for each transfer ensures only the intended recipient can access the data.

*   📂 *Seamless Folder Transfers:* Select an entire folder and KShare will transparently compress it, send it, and decompress it on the other side, perfectly preserving the original directory structure.

*   🚀 *Lightweight and Fast:* Built with efficiency in mind. The application is lightweight, and the direct peer-to-peer connection maximizes your network's bandwidth for rapid transfers of large files.
